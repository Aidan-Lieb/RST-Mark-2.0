    <h1 class="title">Slope Of A Line Calculator</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle">How Do We Calculate This?</h2>
    <p class="explination">The equation we will be using is y=mx+b. But what does that mean? First, we need to remember that this is on a graph, so y and x are coordinates. But what about m and b? Well, m is the slope of the line, and is usually a fraction, where the numerator, or top number, is how much the line goes up, and the denominator, or the bottom number, is how much the line goes to the left or right. Simply put, m is the ratio between how much the line goes up over a certain horizontal distance. Finally, what is b? B is basically just the offset of the line along the y axis. What this means is that b is equal to the y value of the point where the line crosses the y axis. M and b now allow us to input a coordinate for x and get the y coordinate of the point on the line that is at the given x value.</p>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Limitations Of This Calculator</h2>
    <p class="explination">For this calculator to work, every input field must have a value. Also, if you want the variable m to be a whole number, the m2 field must be set to 1.</p>
    <p class="input">M1 (nuemerator) = <input id="m1in" type="number" step="any"></p>
    <p class="input">M2 (denominator) = <input id="m2in" type="number" step="any"></p>
    <p class="input">X = <input id="xin" type="number" step="any"></p>
    <p class="input">B = <input id="bin" type="number" step="any"></p>
